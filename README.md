# Learn Python
## Introduction
This repository will hold all the small Python programming tasks that I finish as I learn this language. My aim is to learn and practice Python until I become a confident full-stack developer. Not just this, but, I also hope others learn the language along with me, with the help of the tasks and solutions in this repository.

Each program is in its own directory, the [Table of Contents](https://github.com/SidSidSid16/Learn-Python3#table-of-contents) shows each program that is in this repository along with a hyperlink to quickly go to that directory. In each program's directory, there is a `README.md` file, which specifies the task and the desired output, and an `app.py` file, which holds the solution.

Following along is very easy, make sure you view the `README.md` for each task that you do before looking at the solution, which is in the `app.py` file.
